Part of its complexity is a discrepancy between what we call anxiety and how we seem to experience anxiety. The emotion itself is well defined and doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound that debilitating (at least if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an anxiety &amp;ldquo;disorder&amp;rdquo; (APA) or &amp;ldquo;medical&amp;rdquo; anxiety(MW) which most people don&amp;rsquo;t want to think of themselves). But if we look at the urban dictionary definitions, the language used is much stronger than that of the APA, or the Merriam Webster.</description></item></channel></rss>
