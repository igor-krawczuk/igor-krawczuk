description: "I'm a board member of the alumni association of the [Manage And More](https://www.manageandmore.de/) entrepreneurial scholarship, serve as a Mentor to young Entrepeneurs (e.g. as part of the [2022 ESADE eWorks program](https://www.esade.edu/en/learning-innovation/rambla/eworks/edtech-accelerator)) and offer online 'office hours' for young founders to critique their business and technology stack. I also occasionally give talks at events, e.g. about blockchain technology at BSL"
