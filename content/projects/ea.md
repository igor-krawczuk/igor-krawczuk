description: "Although I am *NOT* an EA for a various reasons, the Swiss EA communities' focus on AI and governance mean I keep hanging out with them.  I've served as a board member of the EA Geneva association, have tried to bring a diversity of philosophies and angles of criticism into the community as a part of their facilitator program and sporadically give talks about AI risk."
