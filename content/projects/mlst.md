description: "Time Scarfe interviewed my friend [Carla Cremer](https://twitter.com/CarlaZoeC/status/1622877501734125569?cxt=HHwWgoCwzamfz4UtAAAA) and me about our perspectives on X-Risk, Governance in EA and AI risk. I wish we had had time to go into my points about all reasons I don't believe in AGI risk, but I am still glad we could make our points in such a nice format."
