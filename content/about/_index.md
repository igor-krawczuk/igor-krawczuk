An electrical and software engineer by undergrad training, I am currently a researcher and terminal Ph.D. student at the [LIONS]() laboratry at [EPFL]().
My doctoral studies started with neuromorphic computing hardware and slowly drifted into theoretically grounded applied and ML/optimization.
My current research focuses on generative models and reinforcement learning on combinatorial domains like sets and graphs.

I got into ML wanting to understand decision making processes. Together with a politically conscious socialisation in the german hacking scene (particular [CCC]() influenced online spaces)
this [has](has) developed into studying the intersection of computer science, politics and economics, although my lens is of course mainly shaped my engineering and ML background.

As I wrap up my Ph.D. I am looking for new opportunities. Since Switzerland requires private or public employment (read: non-academic) I am now open for offers of emplyoment towards the end of 2023.

I am especially interested to work with especially the following entities:

- tech companies/startups interested in applying rigorous ML and optimization techniques to real world problems, in particular problems involving 
   - combinatorial optimisation
   - requriring formal verification/guarantees
   - game theoretic problems like robustness, mechanism design (think auctions) etc.
- private research entities like foundations or thinktanks which would allow me to work on the above problems, or on the intersection between politics, economics and AI. This can include practical work like PoC technologies to improve governance and policy making, pure research or something in between.
- financial institutions or trading houses who can make use of my gametheory, combinatorial optimization and gametheory academic background as well as my software engineering to develop new ways of managing risks
- policy makers, foundations or public institutions which want to improve their processes and institutional decision making.


but I am also open for consulting work, or out of the box ideas. Generally, I've found that the most interesting opportunities are those you didn't' expect, so please don't hesitate reaching out!
