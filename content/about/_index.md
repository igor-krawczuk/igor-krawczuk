### TL;DR

- I am currently a researcher and terminal Ph. D. student at the [LIONS](https://lions.epfl.ch) laboratry at [EPFL](htttps://epfl.ch). My current research focuses on generative models and reinforcement learning for combinatorial domains, in particular their application to integrated circuit design
 
- Since this is the sales pitch: Without wanting to brag I would say that I am  [T-shaped academic](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2022/t/) person who has done work on almost all aspects of computing, machine learning and optimization by now.
  From hardware design through systems programming with C,C++ and Rust through writing my own CUDA kernels to writing large scale ML and RL systems, as well as supervising over 20 students and interns in the last 4 years. This across a decade in which I've been a Ph.D. student, but also the co-founder of 3 startups, a software and ML prototyping consultant, the sys-admin of our lab, a contributor in lobbying for improved AI governance, and a board-member of various association and NGO boards.

- As my Ph.D. nears its end, I am now looking for suitable applied ML/ML research or leadership roles in tech/finance firms, private research entities or startups to transition to and continue contributing and growing. If you are based in Switzerland and are looking to fill such a role or have other interesting collaborations in mind, please check below whether my profile fits and reach out :-)

### or if you have time:
 
An electrical and software engineer by undergrad training, I am currently a researcher and terminal Ph.D. student at the [LIONS](https://lions.epfl.ch) laboratry at [EPFL](htttps://epfl.ch).
My doctoral studies started with neuromorphic computing hardware and slowly drifted into theoretically grounded applied and ML/optimization.
My current research focuses on generative models and reinforcement learning on combinatorial domains like sets and graphs.

I got into ML wanting to understand decision making processes. Together with a politically conscious socialisation in the german hacking scene (particular [CCC]() influenced online spaces)
this [has](has) developed into studying the intersection of computer science, politics and economics, although my lens is of course mainly shaped my engineering and ML background.

As I wrap up my Ph.D. I am looking for new opportunities. Since Switzerland requires private or public employment (read: non-academic) I am now open for offers of emplyoment towards the end of 2023.

I am especially interested to work with especially the following entities:

- tech companies/startups interested in applying rigorous ML and optimization techniques to real world problems, in particular problems involving 
   - combinatorial optimisation
   - requriring formal verification/guarantees
   - game theoretic problems like robustness, mechanism design (think auctions) etc.
- private research entities like foundations or thinktanks which would allow me to work on the above problems, or on the intersection between politics, economics and AI. This can include practical work like PoC technologies to improve governance and policy making, pure research or something in between.
- financial institutions or trading houses who can make use of my gametheory, combinatorial optimization and gametheory academic background as well as my software engineering to develop new ways of managing risks
- policy makers, foundations or public institutions which want to improve their processes and institutional decision making.


but I am also open for consulting work, or out of the box ideas. Generally, I've found that the most interesting opportunities are those you didn't' expect, so please don't hesitate reaching out!
