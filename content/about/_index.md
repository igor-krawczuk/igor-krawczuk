### TL;DR

- I am currently a researcher and terminal Ph. D. student at the [LIONS](https://lions.epfl.ch) laboratry at [EPFL](htttps://epfl.ch). My current research focuses on generative models and reinforcement learning for combinatorial domains, in particular their application to integrated circuit design.

- As my Ph.D. nears its end, I am now looking for suitable applied ML/ML research or leadership roles in tech/finance firms or private research entities. If you are looking to fill such a role **based in Switzerland**, please check below whether my profile fits and reach out :-) Also open to consulting and other types of collaborations.

### Details about me


Since this is the sales pitch: Without wanting to brag I would say that by now I am a  [T-shaped person](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2022/t/) who has done work on almost all aspects of computing, machine learning and optimization.

Originally trained as an electrical and computer engineer, I am currently a researcher and terminal Ph.D. student at the [LIONS](https://lions.epfl.ch) laboratry at [EPFL](htttps://epfl.ch).
My doctoral studies started with neuromorphic computing hardware - trying to build brain inspired ML accelerators -  and slowly drifted into theoretically grounded applied and ML/optimization.

This has given me the chance to work with the "full stack" of ML research and engineering. During my Ph.D. I have done hardware design, systems programming with C,C++ and Rust, written my own CUDA kernels as well as large scale ML and RL systems in tensorflow, pytorch and jax.
I also supervised over 20 students and interns and worked with half a doze industrial partners.
Finally in the last decade I've not only been been a Ph.D. student, but also the co-founder of 3 startups, a software and ML prototyping consultant, the sys-admin of our lab, a contributor in lobbying for improved AI governance, and a board-member of various association and NGO boards.

### My interests


Whie my current research focuses on sample efficient distributional modeling and reinforcement learning methods on combinatorial domains like sets and graphs, I got into ML wanting to understand decision making processes in adaptive systems.

Together with a politically conscious socialisation in the german hacking scene (particular [CCC]() influenced online spaces)
this [has](has) developed into studying the intersection of computer science and politics and economics, although my lens is of course mainly shaped my engineering and ML background.

As such I am interested in developing in using applied ML methods to study and improve corporate, econimic and political decision making processes[^1]



As I wrap up my Ph.D. I am looking for new opportunities. Since Switzerland requires private or public employment (read: non-academic) I am now open for offers of emplyoment towards the end of 2023.

I am especially interested to work with especially the following entities:

- tech companies/startups interested in applying rigorous ML and optimization techniques to real world problems, in particular problems involving 
   - combinatorial optimisation
   - requriring formal verification/guarantees
   - game theoretic problems like robustness, mechanism design (think auctions) etc.
- private research entities like foundations or thinktanks which would allow me to work on the above problems, or on the intersection between politics, economics and AI. This can include practical work like PoC technologies to improve governance and policy making, pure research or something in between.
- financial institutions or trading houses who can make use of my gametheory, combinatorial optimization and gametheory academic background as well as my software engineering to develop new ways of managing risks
- policy makers, foundations or public institutions which want to improve their processes and institutional decision making.


but I am also open for consulting work, or out of the box ideas. Generally, I've found that the most interesting opportunities are those you didn't' expect, so please don't hesitate reaching out!
